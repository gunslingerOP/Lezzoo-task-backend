# What is this?

An answer to the e-commerce task which was a part of my interview with Lezzoo.

# Tech used

## Prisma

This would be my second app using Prisma as my ORM, it has been very smooth, much more optimized than typeORM.

## Mysql

This will be my first time using Mysql as I've always used Postgresql

## NodeJS & ExpressJS

Not my first rodeo using these two, smooth development experience and large community support, especially for express.

# Functionality

This is a fully functioning API (based on the task instructions) where users can add shops, categories to those shops and products to the categories and shops. Users can get their data and the shop's data efficiently as well.
